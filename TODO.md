at which point du we set the deposit's status released or claimed?


ChatGPT said:
Great question â€” hereâ€™s a clean rule for when to update order_deposit.status to either RELEASED or CLAIMED, based on the action history:

âœ… Decision Rules
Set status = RELEASED when:
The total released amount = full deposit

AND claimed amount = 0

ðŸ’¡ Means: no issues, deposit fully refunded

Set status = CLAIMED when:
Any amount is claimed (partial or full)

Regardless of whether anything was released

ðŸ’¡ Means: owner is keeping part or all of it

Keep status = HELD when:
No actions yet (initial state)

Or only partial releases or still pending decisions

âœ… Optional: Automate it via SQL
If you're using Option A (no denormalized totals), you can create a SQL VIEW or materialized view that derives the current status like:


CASE
  WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN action_type = 'RELEASE' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) = d.amount
       AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_deposit_action WHERE order_deposit_id = d.id AND action_type = 'CLAIM')
    THEN 'RELEASED'
  WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_deposit_action WHERE order_deposit_id = d.id AND action_type = 'CLAIM')
    THEN 'CLAIMED'
  ELSE 'HELD'
END AS computed_status
Let me know if you want a full SQL view snippet.
